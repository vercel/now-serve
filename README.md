# now-serve

This packages makes it very easy to [share directories](https://zeit.co/blog/serve-it-now) using [now](https://zeit.co/now)!

## How it works

When running the `ns` command, a temporary directory gets created. Within that directory, now-serve will insert a brand new `package.json` that conforms to [now's requirements](https://zeit.co/now#get-started) and therefore contains a start script that runs a new instance of [micro-list](https://github.com/zeit/micro-list) when being executed on our servers.

All of this happens completely automatically. So after running the command, the only thing you need to do is wait a few seconds until your files have been deployed and share the link! :boom:

## Usage

Install it

```bash
▲ npm install now-serve -g
```

Run it

```bash
▲ ns [options] <file | dir>
```

You can find a list of all options [below](#options).

2. Uninstall now-serve if it's already installed: `npm uninstall now-serve -g`
